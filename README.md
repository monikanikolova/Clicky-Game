# Clicky Game
This application is a homework assignment for UNCC Bootcamp. 
Clicky-Game renders different images to the screen and each image reacts to clicks.
The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
